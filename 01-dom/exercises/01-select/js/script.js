const init = () => {
  // Question 1: select one element that has a class subtitle.
  // Also check the type of the result using typeof

  // Question 2: select all elements that have a class subtitle. Also chdck the type of the result

  // Question 3: select for each episode the span element that contains the title

  // Question 4: Select the text AIRS SUNDAYS 9/8C without changing the structure of the document
  // You can select an element within another element in CSS using the > operator in the querySelector method

  // Question 5: select the first episode (the entire <li> element) from the episode-list..
  // TIP: firstChild will always return the first node which is mostly an empty textnode. This is because of the whitespace (for example: an enter) in the code
  // Therefore, it is recommended to use firstElementChild. This will always return the first HTML element

  // Question 6: select the penultimate episode (the entire <li> element) from the episode-list

  // Question 7: select the first episode from the list again and request the content of this element using textContent and innerHTML
  // compare the output and request the type of the output

  // Question 8: reuse the element with the class subtitle and request the textContent and innerHTML. What do you notice?
